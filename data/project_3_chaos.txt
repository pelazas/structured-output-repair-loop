Line Items:
1. Heavy Steel Beams (Category: Hardware)
   - 5 units at $1,200.00 each. 
   - I've listed the total as $6,500.00 for some reason? Let's fix that.

Financial Summary:

Notes: 
Please extract the most accurate data. 
If the math in the summary contradicts the items, prioritize the item prices.
Tax should only be applied to Hardware and Services.
Software is exempt.
Tax is calculated AFTER the subtotal is summed, but before the discount is taken? 
No, wait - apply the discount to the subtotal, THEN calculate tax? 
Actually, just apply tax to the raw taxable subtotal as per standard treaty.
Final grand total must be Subtotal - Discount + Tax.
